description: """
In his epic poem The Odyssey, Homer described the island of Crete as "out in the wine-dark sea a rich and lovely sea-girt land, densely peopled, with 90 cities and several different languages." Crete was the birthplace of the mighty
Minoan civilization, which is one of the
oldest in Europe. It appeared two thousand years before the birth of Homer. The Greeks will later call the Minoan supremacy "thalassocracy" or "the empire of the sea" spread throughout the Mediterranean.
The Minoans had no city walls and built no temples. They did not conquer the world with armies of warriors. But their stunning architecture and amazing arts deeply influenced the Mycenaean civilization the era of mythical heroes, sung by Homer much later.
